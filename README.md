# SearchDoc
PROBLEM STATEMENT
There are tonnes of documents out there containing a lot of information. There is a need for a web-based search engine or a bot that can quickly give us the answers by reading the document.

OUR SOLUTION
We have trained our model to answer questions related to a document. It can be any type of document, for ex:- documentation of a framework or a library, digital notes or study material, textbooks, novels, etc. Whenever a query is given to the model, it will provide a concise answer to the question. If asked to summarise a chapter or describe an entity, it does that too.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Haystack
2. Google Colab
3. Elastic search
4. Python

FUTURE SCOPE
The model has a huge scope of expansion.
In terms of technology, it could be done as follows:
1. Integrate this with a chatbot or a web based application in various domains.
2. Integrate other services like those from MS Azure so that the model will have enhanced features.
3. Use deep learning algorithms to improve the quality of output.

In terms of real life applications, following are some of the domains this could be used in:
1. For working professionals, browsing through emails is a big task. This could be used to see what information has been communicated to whom.
2. For developers, it can help them search through huge documentations of services.
3. Help people prepare for certification courses ; one way of doing that is training the model to generate random question and answers.
4. Help students browse through digital study materials.
