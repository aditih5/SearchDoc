# SearchDoc
PROBLEM STATEMENT
There are tonnes of documents out there containing a lot of information. There is a need for a web-based search engine or a bot that can quickly give us the answers by reading the document.

OUR SOLUTION
We have trained our model to answer questions related to a document. It can be any type of document, for ex:- documentation of a framework or a library, digital notes or study material, textbooks, novels, etc.
